# ESP8266_DIGITAL_CLOCK
In this Repository, I will design a digital clock:
+ Main devices: NODEMCU ESP8266, LCD1602, 2button, wire;
+ Time is manually setting by 2nd Button;
+ State of Clock (run normally, hour/minute/second setting, STOPWATCH*) is changed by 1st Button;  

**STOPWATCH:**
- Run time independently with Normal clock but with the same cycle;
- Start/Resume or Stop by 2nd button;


*I used LiquidCrystal_I2C library by **@joaopedrosgs**\ (https://github.com/fdebrabander/Arduino-LiquidCrystal-I2C-library/blob/master/LiquidCrystal_I2C.h)\
**Many thanks for this support**
